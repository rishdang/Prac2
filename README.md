Pra-C2 is a thing that I wrote just for lulz, during a long winter night. The code is somewhat messy, but it works.
Too many comments, AI assisted (thanks, Co-Pilot) but not AI written. I observed a lot of issues in AI code and found it introduced new issues instead of fixing some. Consider this as a hobby C2 code so that I can polish my rusty C and Python skills along with paradigms.

I know a lot can be refactored here, but at this point I just want to see how far I can push this from a concept PoV.
